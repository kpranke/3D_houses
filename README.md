## Description
This project is a part of the Becode.org AI Bootcamp programme. The goal is to produce a 3D plot of a house situated in Flanders, Belgium with only the address of the house provided.

## Objectives

- to be able to search and implement new libraries
- to be able to read and use the [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) format
- to be able to read and use geoTIFFs
- to be able to render a 3D plot
- to be able to present a final product
